#' LASSO2 Variable Selection and Regular Regression Modeling
#' 
#' @description
#' This function performs variable selection with LASSO2 but ignores the shrunk LASSO coefficients and builds a regular regression model.
#' 
#' @details
#' The first part of LASSO2_reg involves variable selection with LASSO2, which is typically performed using cross-validation-based LASSO regression. 
#' However, when only one or no variable is selected, the cross-validation results are ignored, and a minimum of two remaining variables 
#' is ensured through full-data lambda simulations.
#' The second part of LASSO2_reg involves ignoring the shrunk LASSO coefficients and building a regular regression model.
#' It is suitable for three types of outcomes: continuous, binary, and time-to-event.
#' @param data A data matrix or a data frame where samples are in rows, and features/traits are in columns.
#' @param standardization A logical variable to indicate if standardization is needed before variable selection. The default is FALSE.
#' @param columnWise A logical variable to indicate if column-wise or row-wise normalization is needed. The default is TRUE, which performs column-wise normalization. 
#'        This is only meaningful when "standardization" is TRUE.
#' @param biomks A vector of potential biomarkers for variable selection. They should be a subset of column names in "data". 
#' @param outcomeType The outcome variable type. There are three choices: "binary" (default), "continuous", and "time-to-event".
#' @param Y The outcome variable name when the outcome type is either "binary" or "continuous".
#' @param time The time variable name when the outcome type is "time-to-event".
#' @param event The event variable name when the outcome type is "time-to-event".
#' @param nfolds The number of folds for cross-validation. The default value is 10.
#' @param outfile A string for the output file including the path, if necessary, but without the file type extension.

#' # As an example, let's define Xvars, which will be used later:

#' # The function can work with three different outcome types. 
#' # Here, we use time-to-event as an example:
#' tlr = LASSO2_reg(data = tdat, biomks = Xvars,
