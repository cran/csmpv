#' XGpred: Building Risk Classification Predictive Models using Survival Data
#' 
#' @description
#' The XGpred function is designed to generate an empirical Bayesian-based binary risk classification model with survival data based on our novel XGpred algorithm, 
#' combining XGBoost and traditional survival analysis.
#' 
#' @details
#' If variable selection is needed, three variable selection methods are provided. Either the given variable or the selected variable list is used to build both an XGBoost model
#' and a traditional Cox model. Risk scores for each model are calculated and ranked, then averaged for each sample. 
#' The top 1/3 of samples are defined as the high-risk group, while the bottom 1/3 of samples are defined as the low-risk group. 
#' The binary risk classification model is built based on these two risk groups using either the given variable or the selected variable list. 
#' The model is a linear combination of these variables, with weights defined as t values derived from the single-variable linear model
#' of each variable on the two groups. Finally, the classification is based on empirical Bayesian probabilities.
#' 

#' @param data A data matrix or a data frame where samples are in rows and features/traits are in columns.
#' @param varsIn A vector of variables used for the prediction model.
#' @param selection Logical. Default is FALSE. If TRUE, three variable selection methods can be chosen.
#' @param vsMethod When "selection" is set to TRUE, three variable selection methods can be chosen, with LASSO2 as the default method. The other two methods
#'                 are "LASSO2plus" and "LASSO_plus."
#' @param time Time variable name.
#' @param event Event variable name.
#' @param nrounds The maximum number of boosting iterations.
#' @param probcut Probability cutoff for risk group classification. Default is set to 0.8.
#' @param nclass Number of risk groups. By default, it is 2; any samples not classified into high-risk groups are classified into the low-risk group. 
#'               When 3 is chosen, samples are classified into low, middle, and high-risk groups.
#' @param topN An integer indicating how many variables to select if LASSO_plus is chosen as the variable selection method.
#' @param outfile A string for the output file, including the path if necessary but without a file type extension.
#' @param nthread The number of parallel threads used to run XGBoost.
#' @param gamma The minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree.
#' @param max_depth The maximum depth of a tree. Increasing this value will make the model more complex and more likely to overfit.
#' @param outfile A string for the output file, including the path if necessary but without the file type extension.
#' @param eta The step size shrinkage used in the update to prevent overfitting.
